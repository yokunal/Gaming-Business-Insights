Gaming User Analytics & Revenue Drivers: Python-Only Project
This project provides an end-to-end data analysis solution for understanding key user segments, engagement behaviors, and revenue drivers in the gaming industry. Leveraging Python for data wrangling, EDA, visualization, and regression, the notebook guides stakeholders from raw data to business strategy and action.

Project Steps
1. Set Up the Environment
- **Tools** Used: Jupyter Notebook, Python (3.8+), VS Code (recommended).

-**Goal** Prepare a clean workspace and install all required packages for seamless development and analysis.

2. Obtain & Place the Dataset
Add your user-level gaming data (e.g., your_dataset.csv) to the data/ directory.

If the dataset is confidential, provide instructions for users to add their own data file.

3. Install Required Libraries & Load Data
Required Libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn squarify scikit-learn
```
Loading the Data:

python
```bash
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data/your_dataset.csv')   # Update to your file path
df.head()
```
4. Explore the Data
Goal: Understand the structure, missing values, and distributions.

Key Steps:

Use .info(), .describe(), and count plots for demographics/features.

Visualize key columns (device, genre, gender, payment method) for quality assurance and context.

5. Clean the Data
Remove duplicates and handle missing/null values.

Convert categorical fields to the appropriate types.

Prepare features for modeling (including one-hot encoding for regression).

6. Analyze User Segments & Revenue Patterns
Distribution plots for demographics, device preference, payment methods, session counts.

Revenue and ARPU by device, genre, and age group.

Time-to-first-purchase analysis by game genre.

7. Regression Modeling
Goal: Quantify which features (demographic, behavioral, platform) predict higher user spend.

Steps:

One-hot encode categorical variables.

Train/test split and fit a linear regression.

Display and interpret coefficients and feature importances.

8. Business Insights and Recommendations
After each major plot/KPI, summarize actionable insights and suggestions for growth or optimization in clear Markdown.

Results and Insights
Top Spending Segments: Older users (35â€“59) and users playing genres such as Battle Royale, Strategy, and MMORPG generate the highest average spend.

Engagement Patterns: iOS users spend more per capita, but Android dominates in volume.

Monetization Timing: Most first purchases occur within 15 days; timely offers yield best results.

Actionable KPIs: Graphs and regression pinpoint the precise segments and behaviors driving revenue growth.

Business Applications
Data-driven support for user acquisition, retention, and monetization strategies

Segmentation, targeting, and prioritizing high-value genres and platforms

Optimizing onboarding and purchase timing windows
